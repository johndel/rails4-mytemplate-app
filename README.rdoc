== Basic template for rails apps

This is a basic admin panel with bootstrap and rails 4 apps. I've organized and separated each asset, I've added the gems that I like and I'll use it for basic prototypes that I want to build. Feel free to do suggestions.

Well, do a grep and change the name TemplateApp whenever you want
Change the file config/initializers/secret_token.rb
Change the db/seeds/01_users.rb
Do a rake db:dev:init (it needs postgresql)

...and you are good to go with a basic setup!
